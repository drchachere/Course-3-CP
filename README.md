run_analysis.R
______________

run_analysis.R is a script that creates a final dataset, df_2.csv.

Df_2.csv has been created from data from UCI_HAR_Dataset/.  Measurements were grouped by activity and testing participant ("subject"), and then averages for each measurement for each group were taken. Please see CodeBook.md for details regarding how Df_2.csv has been created.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
